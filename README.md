Microsoft Word Office Add-in

1.  Introduction
    This README serves as a guide for understanding and working with the Microsoft Word Office Add-ins in the context of the template app. It contains essential information about installation, setup, and usage, aiming to ensure a consistent and efficient developer experience.

2.  Prerequisites
    To start developing and contributing to the project, ensure that the following software is installed on your machine:

    Microsoft Word
    Git (Version Control System)
    Node.js (LTS version, e.g., 16.13.0 or higher)
    npm (Node Package Manager)
    Yeoman Generator
    Visual Studio Code (IDE for JavaScript/TypeScript)
    Windows Terminal (Powerful terminal for Windows)

3.  Getting Started
    Follow these steps to get started with the Microsoft Word Office Add-ins for the template app:

    3.1. Clone the Repository

    Clone the repository using the following commands:

        git clone https://github.com/Davidoff9/OfficeWordAdd-in.git

    3.2. Installation and Setup

        1. Yeoman Generator vs. Visual Studio

            When setting up your Microsoft Word Office Add-in project, you have two main options: using the Yeoman Generator for Office Add-ins or developing directly within Visual Studio.

            Using Yeoman Generator:

            Pros:

                Quick Start: Yeoman generator provides a streamlined way to create a new Office Add-in project with the necessary files and structure.
                Templates: Yeoman offers various templates to kick-start your project, saving time on setting up the initial structure.
                Cross-Platform: Works across different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
                Modern Technologies: Encourages the use of modern web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

            Cons:

                Learning Curve: If you're new to Yeoman, there might be a learning curve to understand its commands and options.
                Customization: While the generator offers templates, you may need to make further adjustments to meet your project's specific needs.

        2. Using Visual Studio:

        Pros:

            Integrated Environment: Visual Studio provides an integrated environment for Office Add-in development, combining coding, debugging, and testing.
            UI Designers: Offers visual designers for creating UI components, making it easier for designers to contribute.
            Advanced Features: Supports advanced coding features, debugging tools, and extensions for productivity.
            Comprehensive: Offers templates for various Office Add-in types, making it suitable for a range of projects.

        Cons:

            Platform Dependent: Visual Studio is primarily available on Windows, which might limit collaboration on different platforms.
            Heavier IDE: Visual Studio is a larger and more resource-intensive IDE compared to lightweight code editors.
            Learning Curve: Mastering all of Visual Studio's features can take time, especially for developers new to the environment.
            Ultimately, the choice between Yeoman and Visual Studio depends on your familiarity with the tools, the complexity of your project, and your preferred workflow. Yeoman offers a quick start and flexibility, while Visual Studio provides a powerful integrated environment for advanced development and design.

    Using Yeoman Generator:
    Install the required packages:

            npm install -g yo generator-office

        Create a new Word Office Add-in project:

            yo office

        Follow the prompts to set up your project, choosing appropriate options.

    3.3. Development

        1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

            code .

        2. Starting the project:

            Windows:

                Open Windows Terminal and navigate to your project's directory:

                    cd path/to/your/word-add-in-project

                Start the project using the following command:

                    npm start

                This command will build and launch the add-in in.

            MacOS:

                Open Terminal and navigate to your project's directory:

                    cd path/to/your/word-add-in-project

                Start the project using the following command:

                    npm run dev-server

                This command will build and launch the add-in in.

        3. Project Structure

            The project is structured as follows:

            manifest.xml: This XML file is the heart of the Office Add-in. It defines the add-in's metadata, such as its name, description, icons, permissions, and entry points (like task panes, commands, etc.).

            src/taskpane/taskpane.css: This CSS file defines the styling for the task pane UI. Customize the styles here to ensure your add-in matches your desired look and feel.

            src/taskpane/taskpane.html: This HTML file represents the content of the task pane. You can modify this to create the user interface of your add-in.

            src/taskpane/taskpane.js: The JavaScript file for the task pane logic. Add your scripting here to make your add-in interactive and functional.

            src/commands/commands.js: This JavaScript file defines the actions that can be executed by buttons or other UI elements in your add-in. Link these actions to commands defined in the manifest.

        4. Edit the Code

            manifest.xml: Configure the add-in's metadata, permissions, entry points, and buttons.

            src/taskpane/taskpane.css: Modify the styling to create a visually appealing and consistent design.

            src/taskpane/taskpane.html: Design the user interface using HTML elements and layout structures.

            src/taskpane/taskpane.js: Implement JavaScript functionality to interact with the document and provide dynamic behavior.

            src/commands/commands.js: Define actions that can be triggered by user interaction and link them to commands in the manifest.
            Edit the code in the src folder to implement your desired functionality.

            Test the add-in locally using the provided Word Desktop or Web version.
